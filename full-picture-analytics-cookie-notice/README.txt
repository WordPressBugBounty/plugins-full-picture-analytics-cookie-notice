== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin slow down page loading? =

Yes, just like any other plugin, but by a very, veeery small amount.

WP Full Picture is modular, which means it only loads what is necessary. Aditionally, all files are loaded asynchronously, which does not block loading of other page elements and works well with caching tools.

= Is WP Full Picture compatible with page builders? =

Yes. We tested it with Gutenberg, Elementor, Bricks, Breakdance.

Only Bricks requires (one small tweak)[https://wpfullpicture.com/support/documentation/how-to-fix-tracking-issues-in-bricks-builder/] to track interactions with WooCommerce product lists.

= Can I only use WP Full Picture's consent banner with other analytics plugins? =

Yes. You can use it to control tracking scripts installed by other plugins and load them according to privacy laws. 

WP Full Picture automatically handles all plugins that load Google Analytics, Ads and Microsoft Advertising. It can also control the loading og PixelYourSite, Jetpack stats and tools loaded with Pixel Manager for WooCommerce.

= Can I use a different consent management plugin or platform (CookieBot, Iubenda, CookieYes, etc.) with WP Full Picture? =

No. WP Full Picture's modules for installing analytics tools are only optimized to work with WP Full Picture's consent banner.

= Can I use WP Full Picture on a website that displays ads? =

At the moment there is not a single free consent management tool that lets you show ads from Google Adsense and other advertising platforms. To do it, the tool needs to use a IAB TCF framework which WP Full Picture does not use even in the paid version.

= Does WP Full Picture support Google's consent mode v2? =

Yes. Consent mode v2 is fully supported. It works with Google Analytics, Google Ads and GTM. It works out-of-the-box. Simply, enable the consent banner module and it will work.

= Is WP Full Picture certified by Google?

Google certifies only tools that support Google Adsense (for displaying ads on your own site) and use IAB TCF framework. WP Full Picture doesn't do it. At the moment only paid Consent Management Platforms use this framework. No free tool has it.

= Does WP Full Picture lists individual cookies in a privacy policy?

No. This is a popular myth. Listing cookies is not required by law, plus it is technically doable only on simple sites. You can [learn more about it here](https://wpfullpicture.com/blog/does-gdpr-require-you-to-list-cookies-on-your-website/).

= Does WP Full Picture generate privacy policies?

No. We recommend you use a specialized service for this.

= How does WP Full Picture's cookie notice block cookies?

Depending on the tracking tool, WP Full Picture either instructs the tool not to load cookies or blocks scripts that create these cookies.

= Is WP Full Picture's consent banner limited in any way? =

No. It can be displayed unlimited number of times, on unlimited pages by unlimited number of visitors.

= I live in the EU, but I want to start tracking visitors right after they visit the page. Can I do this? =

Technically, you can. Legally you can't.

= Will my site comply with ALL privacy regulations just by using WP Full Picture? =

No. Privacy regulations cover many areas of business. WP Full Picture helps you handle only a part of it, so you still need to be aware and act accordingly to be fully compliant with the rest of them.

= Can I translate texts in the cookie notice? =

Yes. WP Full Picture has been tested and works with multilingual plugins WPML and Polylang. It is possible that it also works with other plugins but we haven't tested them.

= Does WP Full Picture generate product feeds for Google Shopping or Facebook? =

No. WP Full Picture is focused on tracking and privacy. To generate a product catalogue you can use one of many plugins from WordPress repository or cloud platforms.

= Does WP Full Picture display statistics in the dashboard? =

Yes. WP Full Picture lets you display in your WP admin panel reports and dashboards created in Google Looker Studio, Databox and other similar services. 

These platforms allow you to create advanced reports with aggregated data from various analytics and marketing tools, Google spreadsheets and even WooCommerce data.
