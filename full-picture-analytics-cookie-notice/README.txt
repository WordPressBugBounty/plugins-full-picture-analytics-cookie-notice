## ⚙️ HOW DOES IT WORK?

## 👌 ALTERNATIVE TO...

WP Full Picture replaces multiple analytics and privacy plugins. This helps avoid conflicts between plugins and makes your workflow simpler and faster.

You can use WP FP instead of:

- plugins that install tracking tools, like PixelYourSite, Pixel Manager for WooCommerce, MonsterInsights and others,
- GTM4WP plugin - WP Full Picture includes its own Google Tag Manager integration and an alternative, lightweight Custom Scripts module,
- consent solutions - WP FP comes with a consent banner and other privacy solutions which seamlessly integrate with all your tracking tools.

## 🛒 WOOCOMMERCE TRACKING

We've integrated 14 tracking tools with WooCommerce - from Google Analytics and GTM to Hotjar and Matomo - so that you can gain deep insights into:

- **Sales performance:** Monitor important metrics like purchases, checkouts, items added to carts, and cart abandonment rates.
- **Customer behavior:** Use session recordings to watch how customers navigate through your product categories and pages.
- **Marketing performance:** Track how well your product campaigns are doing across different channels like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and email marketing.

## 👁️ CUSTOM TRACKING

With WP Full Picture, you can track more than what tracking tools give you by default. WP FP helps you track and send them detailed information on user actions and events:

- **WooCommerce:** Track what customers do, from viewing products and adding items to their carts to making purchases.
- **User interactions:** Track when people click or see specific page elements.
- **Affiliate marketing:** Keep track of how often your affiliate links are clicked to measure their effectiveness.
- **Form submissions:** See how often people fill out forms on your website, such as contact forms or registration forms.
- **Content engagement:** Understand user behavior by tracking things like how far they scroll, how long they are engaged with the content, what page elements and ads they see and click on.

## 🤝 PRIVACY COMPLIANCE

WP Full Picture includes a range of privacy features to help you follow rules like GDPR, PIPEDA, CNIL, and RODO.

- **Consent Banner:** Show a banner to get user permission for tracking (compatible with Google's Consent Mode v2).
- **Iframes Manager:** Control the loading of YouTube videos, maps and other content from external websites which track your visitors.
- **Safe Fonts Module:** Replace Google Fonts with fonts that don't send data to Google's servers, protecting user privacy.
- **Tracking Tools Manager:** Manage tracking tools from other plugins and turn them off for users who don't agree to tracking.

And also:

- **GDPR Setup Helper:** View a detailed information on how to set up tracking so that it complies with GDPR
- **Records of consent:** Save visitors' tracking preferences in our cloud database (Available for unbeatable price. [See the pricing](https://wpfullpicture.com/pricing/#hook_cdb_plans/).)

## 📊 IN-ADMIN TRAFFIC & MARKETING REPORTS

Easily see your website's traffic stats and marketing performance right from your WordPress admin dashboard.

Create reports with tools like Looker Studio, Databox, or other similar platforms, and view them directly in your WordPress admin area. Plus, if the platform you choose, has an app, then you can also check your reports on your phone. This makes it simple to keep track of visitor trends, marketing costs, and how well your campaigns are doing - all from one place.

## 💎 WP FULL PICTURE PRO -  Advanced Solutions for Businesses

- **Advanced order tracking:** Tracks up to 30% more orders in Google Analytics and Meta Pixel using advanced server-side tracking.
- **Lead scoring:** Analyzes how effective your traffic sources are and helps create custom audiences based on where visitors are in the conversion process.
- **Advanced Triggers:** Lets you tracks multi-event user actions, like visiting 5 product pages or showing interest in a product.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there anything I should know before I start using the plugin? =

Yes. If you use a caching plugin or a tool like Autoptimize, make sure to turn off the settings that combine and minifiy JavaScript files. These can cause issues with the plugin.

= Is WP Full Picture compatible with page builders? =

Yes. We tested it with Elementor, Bricks, Breakdance and saw no issues.

= Does WP Full Picture support WooCommerce and new WooCommerce blocks? =

Yes. Both classic WooCommerce elements and new blocks are supported in 14 different tools and Google Tag Manager.

WP Full Picture tracks events like purchases, checkouts, add-to-cart events, and more.

= Does WP Full Picture display statistics in the dashboard? =

Yes. WP Full Picture lets you display in your WP admin panel reports and dashboards created in Google Looker Studio, Databox and other similar services. 

These platforms allow you to create advanced reports with aggregated data from various analytics and marketing tools, Google spreadsheets and even WooCommerce data.

= Does WP Full Picture support Google's consent mode v2? =

Yes. Consent mode v2 is fully supported. It works with Google Analytics, Google Ads and GTM. You can enable it in the settings of the cookie notice / consent banner.

= Will I need a consent management plugin or platform (CookieBot, Iubenda, CookieYes, etc.) after I switch to WP Full Picture? =

In most cases, no. You will need it only if you display on your website ads from platforms like Google Adsense - they require FTC certification from a cookie managment solution and WP Full Picture does not have it at the moment.

= How does WP Full Picture's cookie notice block cookies?

WP Full Picture doesn't need to block cookies. Instead, it blocks scripts that install and use these cookies. The end result is the same, but the website works a little bit faster because it loads the tracking scripts only after the visitor agrees to cookies.

= Is WP Full Picture's cookie notice limited in any way? =

No. Unlike consent management platforms (CMPs), we don't limit the use of the notice in any way. It can be displayed unlimited number of times, on unlimited pages by unlimited number of visitors.

= Do I have to use the WP Full Picture's cookie notice? =

No you don't. All the modules can be used separately.

= I live in the EU, but I want to start tracking visitors right after they visit the page. Can I do this? =

Technically, you can. Legally you can't.

= Will my site comply with ALL privacy regulations just by using WP Full Picture? =

No. Privacy regulations cover many areas of business. WP Full Picture helps you handle only a part of it, so you still need to be aware and act accordingly to be fully compliant with the rest of them.

= I am using a different cookie notice. Can I keep using it? =

Yes you can, but you have to test it if it correctly blocks tracking scripts loaded by WP Full Picture before users agree to tracking. Vvast majority of cookie management solutions do not comply with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA, even if they claim so!

= Can I translate texts in the cookie notice? =

Yes. WP Full Picture has been tested and works with multilingual plugins WPML and Polylang. It is possible that it also works with other plugins but we haven't tested them.

= Is WP FP compatible with caching plugins?

WP Full Picture is compatible with W3 Total Cache, WP-Optimize, WP Rocket, WP Fastest Cache, Breeze, Siteground Cache, WP Super Cache, Cache Enabler, Litespeed Cache, Comet Cache, Hummingbird, WP Engine ceche and Autoptimize.

Attention! We noticed that WP Multisite installations with LiteSpeed Cache plugin do not clear cache network-wide when the plugin is updated. In such case, cache needs to be cleared manually - visit every site in the network and click "purge cache" button.

= Is WP Full Picture incompatible with any plugins or themes? =

Yes. So far we have noticed that the plugin has problems with:

- OceanWP theme - Consent Banner settings do not show in the Theme Customizer
- Kubio theme - the theme uses CSS styles that makes WP FP's Consent Banner show in the center of the page instead of the screen. To fix it, please add to your website this custom CSS `body#kubio{transform: none !important;}`
- Vertice theme - the same problem and solution as above

= Does WP Full Picture generate product feeds for Google Shopping or Facebook? =

No. WP Full Picture is focused on tracking and privacy. To generate a product catalogue you can use one of many plugins from WordPress repository or cloud platforms.
